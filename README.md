Magic ratio

Bringing forth the idea of applying ratio range 2/3 - 3/4, preferably centered away from endpoints, to physical exercise.

For instance, to rep & set patterns and timings 

To separate 2/3 - 3/4 instances, potentially rotate 180 degrees counterclockwise

So, 7 lunges, 180 degree body/torso rotation, 10 lunges
