Magic ratio

Bringing forth the idea of applying ratio range 2/3 - 3/4, preferably centered away from endpoints, to physical exercise.

For instance, to rep & set patterns and timings 

To separate 2/3 - 3/4 instances, potentially rotate 180 degrees counterclockwise & lightly say "ok" as rotating

My idea of best practice: While "ok" is uttered casually on set to set rotation, I like to rotate and pace/extend utterance so 3 times CCW then 3 CW where I say "ok" as I make a full rotation left and "no" as I made a full rotation right. 

So, 7 lunges, 180 degree body/torso rotation, 10 lunges

Otherwise, and generally, a good pattern is 7-5 ; 5-7 ; 7-5 ; 5-7
